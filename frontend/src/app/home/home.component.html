    <h1>Basketball API</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Basketball API application! This platform provides a comprehensive simulation of player data using various API endpoints. It is built with a robust backend powered by Django and PostgreSQL, and a dynamic Angular frontend for seamless user interaction.</p>
    <p>The backend implements a normalized PostgreSQL database to store player and game data. API endpoints allow you to retrieve detailed player summaries, including game statistics and shot locations, which are visualized in the frontend.</p>
    <p>The frontend includes a `player-summary` component that fetches and displays player data, such as shot coordinates relative to the basket. This data is presented in an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy to analyze player performance.</p>
